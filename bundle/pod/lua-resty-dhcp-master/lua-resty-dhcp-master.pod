lua-resty-dhcp


=head1 Status

This library is already usable though still highly experimental.

The Lua API is still in flux and may change in the near future without notice.




=head1 Synopsis


    stream {
        server {
            listen 10.0.0.1:67 udp;

=head1 Description

This library provides a simple and not by any means complete implementation of
the dhcp packet/protocol. Most of the options are defined as void at this stage,
and will need a typedef to be usable. Please create a pull request if you do so.




=head1 Installation

Copy the contents of the lib directory to a path in ngx-lua's search path or
define the path in nginx's configuration:


    # nginx.conf
    stream {
        lua_package_path "${prefix}/lib/?.lua;;";
    }

And then load the module provided by this library in Lua. For example,


    local dhcpd = require "resty.dhcp.server"
    
    or use packet directly:
    
    local dhcp_packet = require "resty.dhcp.packet"
